[[BR]]'''Title:'''  AWIPS II Localization: Step-By-Step Guide (Draft)
[[BR]]'''Version or Date:'''  Draft 25-feb-2011
[[BR]]'''File Name:''' AWP.DOC.TOSCAT.LOC-01.00.pdf
[[BR]]'''Location:''' https://collaborate.nws.noaa.gov/trac/siteconfig/wiki/LocalizationPage

'''Comment:'''[[BR]]
The "Location" as given above contains a link to the most recent
version of the document.

Written by Raytheon.  Based on Chapter 15 of the SMM.  Modified for the ADAM    hardware configuration.

Paraphrased from email by Kevin Johnson to awips2dev on 04-mar-2011:

    This document was created to help a user take a 
	baseline installed version of
	AWIPS II, which installs as site OAX, and run both EDEX (server
	side) and CAVE (User Interface) as a site other than OAX.

	The document is written in such a way that it can
	be used on an AWIPS system (clustered AWIPS II installation) or
	on ADAM (standalone).  It is not designed for only a baseline
	system, and all steps are necessary to configure both EDEX and
	CAVE on ADAM (or any other AWIPS II install for that matter).

Written by Raytheon.  Submitted with delivery of software.
Instructions for installation of the AWIPS Development Environment (ADE)
on a developer's workstation.  The ADE includes all the AWIPS II source
and third-party tools required for AWIPS II development.  Full
installation of the ADE provides the developer with a working AWIPS II
system, including server and visualization components.  The document
includes instructions for using the Eclipse debugger to access
running instances of the server and visualization processes.

Instructions for deployment of the AWIPS II run time system
on a clustered hardware configuration (several servers,
allowing for redundancy and better performance than on
a standalone sytstem).

'''Comment:'''[[BR]]
The National Core Local Applications Development Team provides support
for the migration of local applications from the legacy AWIPS to AWIPS II.
As they learn about AWIPS II from porting local applications, team
members add content to this wiki.

Content includes (but is by no means limited to):
 *  Many examples of uEngine scripting.  Look in the wiki index under !         EdexUengineScripting.
 *  How to set up subscriptions (the AWIPS II replacement for triggers).  Look  in the wiki index under !HowToSubscriptions.
 *  Supporting documentation for training sessions for those porting local      applications.  Look in the wiki index under !MigrationWorkSessions.

If you're looking for information on AWIPS II internals,
interfaces, and tools this wiki is a good place to start.  Try
the keyword search facility (available from each wiki page).


=== !Raytheon/Omaha External Wiki ===

[[BR]]'''Title:'''  AWIPS2 Omaha

'''Comment:'''[[BR]]
This wiki is maintained by and for Raytheon's AWIPS II
developers.  It is not a contract deliverable -- non-Raytheon
external users have access by Raytheon's courtesy.  Several
tantalizingly-titled pages (examples: "Creating an EDEX Project",
"Index of AWIPS II Design Archive") are on servers that
are inaccessible to users outside Raytheon's firewalls.  Some
pages may be out of date.  Some apply only to Raytheon's
development environment.

Examples of recently-modified, useful-looking pages (you can find
these through the wiki index):
 *  Delta.  AWIPS II Delta Installs / Upgrades
 *  metawiki.  This page provides a subject index to the wiki's content.
 *  Derived parameters.  What they are.  Where the files are located.  How to   define new derived parameters.  How to display them.  Etc.
 *  Serialization.  AWIPS II Serialization APIs: Thrift-dynamic and JAXB.
 *  Localization.
