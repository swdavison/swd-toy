= How To Create a New Development Branch =

Each developer should have his or her own development branch.
In some circumstances one developer might need more than one
branch.  Subversion maintains branches by keeping track of
deltas from the trunk -- branches are cheap in terms of
both disk space and processor load.

Create a branch whenever you need one.  Check code out from
your branch when you need a working copy.  Commit code back
to the branch to save your unfinished work (a "checkpoint"
commit).  Avoid checking out code from the trunk as much as
possible.  Remember that a working copy checked out from the
trunk is at risk of being checked back in to the trunk.
In fact, the only time you really need to check out code
from the trunk is when you are about to make a final delivery
of code.

Delete your development branch after you finish each task.  Then
create a new branch when you need it.

To create a new branch:
{{{
    export ROOT=http://swdavison.dyndns.org:8080/awips2_repo/AiiDh
    svn copy $ROOT/trunk $ROOT/branches/<yourNameHere> -m"Creating new branch"
}}}
