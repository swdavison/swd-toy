\subsection{Setting up Apache httpd and Hudson to Start on Boot}

To make the servers start on boot you must install a startup
script and run the chkconfig utility to have the proper symlinks
put in the proper directories.  The commands are as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
    cd /etc/rc.d/init.d
    tar zxf $SWENV_DOWNLOADS/swenv_utils.tgz httpd.swenv
    tar zxf $SWENV_DOWNLOADS/swenv_utils.tgz hudson.swenv
    chkconfig --add httpd.swenv
    chkconfig httpd.swenv on
    chkconfig --add hudson.swenv
    chkconfig hudson.swenv on
\end{verbatim}

Inspect and edit the startup scripts.  You will probably
have to change the definition of the SWENV\_PROGS environment
variable to suit your installation.


TBD: Backups.  What needs to be backed up.  What could be omitted from
backups (eg Hudson workspaces).
