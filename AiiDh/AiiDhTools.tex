\chapter{AWIPS Development Tools and Techniques}



\section{Eclipse}

Introduction to Eclipse in the context of the ADE and AWIPS II in 
general.  Not meant to take the place of existing publications.  
This section will refer to such publications.  But those
publications take a much broader view of Eclipse.

\section{Ant}

Like the Eclipse subsection.


\section{Developer Testing}

How to get code modules you've built in to your local run time 
environment for testing.

Debugging CAVE in and out of Eclipse

Debugging EDEX in and out of Eclipse

Other Java development support tools: JMeter, etc.
JUnit

Some of this will come from Raytheon flow tags.  Copy them in or 
incorporate by reference.
