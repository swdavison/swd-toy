\subsection{How To Deliver Code to the Trunk}

Source file: AiiDhSwEnUsDc.tex

The first step is to make sure that your development branch is 
up to date with respect to the trunk.  Please see the section
titled ``How To Update a Branch from the Trunk'' and carry out
those steps.

Next, make sure that both the trunk and your development branch
build and pass the regression tests.

The procedure for the delivery merge itself is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
    # ----- Prepare a log message for the delivery commit.  You might
    # -----    start by collecting all the short commit messages you
    # -----    wrote while working.  You should also include any 
    # -----    relevant ticket numbers.
    export ROOT=http://swdavison.dyndns.org:8080/awips2_repo/AiiDh
    export BRANCHURL=$ROOT/branches/<yourNameHere>
    svn log --stop-on-copy $BRANCHURL > ~/commitmessage.tmp
    # ----- Edit the temporary file to create a commit message.
    vi ~/commitmessage.tmp

    # ----- Check out a new working copy from the trunk.
    export TRUNKURL=$ROOT/trunk
    svn checkout $TRUNKURL

    # ----- Merge your development branch into the new working
    # -----    copy of the trunk that you just created.
    cd trunk
    svn merge --reintegrate $BRANCHURL

    # ----- Build and test the newly-merged working copy.

    # ----- Commit the merged working copy back to the trunk.
    svn commit --file ~/commitmessage.tmp

    # ----- Clean up.  You don't need that working copy from the 
    # -----    trunk and it's dangerous to leave it around -- if
    # -----    you forgot it was from the trunk and edited and 
    # -----    committed you would have unwanted changes in the
    # -----    trunk.
    cd ..
    rm -rf trunk

    # ----- More cleanup.  Because of the reintegrate option on the
    # -----    merge command your development branch is no longer 
    # -----    usable.  Delete it.
    svn delete $BRANCHURL -m"Removing reintegrated branch."
\end{verbatim}

Although you just deleted your development branch it isn't really 
gone.  What you really did was to create a new repository version
that does not have that branch.  You could still recover the branch
by specifying an earlier version number in a checkout command.

If you need to create a new development branch for your next
task please see the section
titled ``How To Create a New Development Branch.''
